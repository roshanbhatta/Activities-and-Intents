        \t Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack.
        One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow.
        Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow.
        Jack asked, “What will you give me in return for my cow?”
        The man answered, “I will give you five magic beans!”
        \n\n
        \t Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow.
        But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry.
        She said, “You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!”
        She threw the beans out of the window.
        Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.
        \n\n
        The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window,
        he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans!
        He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky.
        There lived a giant and his wife.
        Jack went inside the house and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen.
        Jack said, “Could you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!”
        The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.
        \n\n
        \t While he was eating, the giant came home.
        The giant was very big and looked very fearsome.
        Jack was terrified and went and hid inside.
        The giant cried, “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.
        Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!”
        The wife said, “There is no boy in here!”
        So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room.
        He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside.
        Then he went to sleep.
        \n\n
        \t In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place,
        took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk.
        At home, he gave the coins to his mother.
        His mother was very happy and they lived well for sometime.</string>

        \t ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits,
        and their names were— Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.
        They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree.
        \n\n
        \t \"NOW, my dears,\" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning,
        \"you may go into the fields or down the lane,
        but don\'t go into Mr. McGregor\'s garden:
        your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"
        \"NOW run along, and don\'t get into mischief. I am going out.\"
        THEN old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, to the baker\'s.
        She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
        FLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies,
        went down the lane to gather blackberries;
        \n\n
        \t BUT Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor\'s garden
        and squeezed under the gate!
        FIRST he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;
        AND then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.
        BUT round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!
        MR. McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages,
        but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, \"Stop thief!\"
        \n\n
        \t PETER was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden,
        for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.
        He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.
        AFTER losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster,
        so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a
        gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.
        It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.

        \t A shoemaker, by no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he had nothing
        left but leather for one pair of shoes. So in the evening, he cut out the shoes which
        he wished to begin to make the next morning, and as he had a good conscience,
        he lay down quietly in his bed, commended himself to God, and fell asleep.
        \n\n
        \t In the morning, after he had said his prayers, and was just going to sit down to work,
        the two shoes stood quite finished on his table.
        He was astounded, and knew not what to say to it.
        He took the shoes in his hands to observe them closer,
        and they were so neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them,
        just as if they were intended as a masterpiece.
        \n\n
        \t Soon after, a buyer came in,
        and as the shoes pleased him so well, he paid more for them than was customary,
        and, with the money, the shoemaker was able to purchase leather for two pairs of shoes.
        He cut them out at night, and next morning was about to set to work with fresh courage;
        but he had no need to do so, for, when he got up, they were already made, and buyers also
        were not wanting, who gave him money enough to buy leather for four pairs of shoes.
        \n\n
        \t The following morning, too, he found the four pairs made; and so it went on constantly,
        what he cut out in the evening was finished by the morning, so that he soon had his honest
        independence again, and at last became a wealthy man.
        Now it befell that one evening not long before Christmas,
        when the man had been cutting out, he said to his wife, before going to bed,
        \"What think you if we were to stay up to-night to see who it is that lends us this
        helping hand?\" The woman liked the idea, and lighted a candle, and then they hid
        themselves in a corner of the room, behind some clothes which were hanging up there,
        and watched.
        \n\n
        \t When it was midnight, two pretty little naked men came,
        sat down by the shoemaker\'s table, took all the work which was cut out before them
        and began to stitch, and sew, and hammer so skilfully and so quickly with their
        little fingers that the shoemaker could not turn away his eyes for astonishment.
        They did not stop until all was done, and stood finished on the table, and they ran
        quickly away.
        \n\n
        \t Next morning the woman said, \"The little men have made us rich,
        and we really must show that we are grateful for it.
        They run about so, and have nothing on, and must be cold.
        I\'ll tell thee what I\'ll do: I will make them little shirts,
        and coats, and vests, and trousers, and knit both of them a pair of stockings,
        and do thou, too, make them two little pairs of shoes.\" The man said,
        \"I shall be very glad to do it;\" and one night, when everything was ready,
        they laid their presents all together on the table instead of the cut-out work,
        and then concealed themselves to see how the little men would behave.
        At midnight they came bounding in, and wanted to get to work at once,
        but as they did not find any leather cut out,
        but only the pretty little articles of clothing, they were at
        first astonished, and then they showed intense delight.
        \n\n
        \t They dressed themselves
        with the greatest rapidity, putting the pretty clothes on, and singing,
        \"Now we are boys so fine to see, Why should we longer cobblers be?\"
        Then they danced and skipped and leapt over chairs and benches.
        At last they danced out of doors. From that time forth they came no more,
        but as long as the shoemaker lived all went well with him,
        and all his undertakings prospered.
